Binary Search:
 ----
 Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target
  value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value 
  to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in
   which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues 
   on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends 
   with the remaining half being empty, 
   
   Your task is
 -
 - to implement binary search
 - your implementation should work correctly with ordered list with one shift like
 
 ```int [] mas= [5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 1, 3, 4]``` 
 
 It means you should modify basic implementation of the BinarySearch.

Merge Sort:
---
 Implement merge sort. Your implementations should perform all actions in-place. 
 It means you can't create additional objects for storing.
